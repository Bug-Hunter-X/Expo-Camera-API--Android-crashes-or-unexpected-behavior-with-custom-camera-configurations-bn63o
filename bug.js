This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with custom camera configurations.  The issue is that setting certain camera options, particularly those related to the focus mode or zoom, can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes, especially on Android devices. The camera might fail to initialize properly, freeze, or produce distorted images.  This is often difficult to debug because Expo doesn't provide detailed error messages in these cases.
